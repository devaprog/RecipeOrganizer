a recipe organizer implemented in Python with SQLAlchemy and SQLite database:

1. **Installation and Setup:**
   - Ensure that Python is installed on your system. If not, download and install Python from the official website.
   - Install the required packages using pip:
     ```
     pip install sqlalchemy passlib click
     ```
   - No separate database setup is required as SQLite is used, which is self-contained.
   - Download the Python script for Project-2 (e.g., `recipe_organizer.py`) or copy the code into a Python file.

2. **Running the Program:**
   - Open your preferred command-line interface (e.g., Terminal on macOS/Linux, Command Prompt on Windows).
   - Navigate to the directory containing the Python script (`recipe_organizer.py`).
   - Run the Python script using the command:
     ```
     python recipe_organizer.py
     ```

3. **User Interactions:**
   - Upon running the program, you'll be presented with a command-line interface (CLI) prompt.
   - The CLI provides various commands for interacting with the recipe organizer:
     - `signup`: Register a new user by providing a username and password (e.g., `signup username,password`).
     - `forgot_password`: Reset the password for an existing user by providing the username (e.g., `forgot_password username`).
     - `add`: Add a new recipe by providing the recipe name, ingredients, instructions, notes, cuisine, and category (e.g., `add name,ingredients,instructions,notes,cuisine,category`).
     - `edit`: Edit an existing recipe by providing the recipe ID, along with updated details (e.g., `edit recipe_id,name,ingredients,instructions,notes,cuisine,category`).
     - `delete`: Delete a recipe by providing the recipe ID (e.g., `delete recipe_id`).
     - `search`: Search for recipes containing a specific keyword in their name (e.g., `search keyword`).
     - `exit`: Exit the program.

4. **Security Considerations:**
   - Avoid sharing sensitive information like passwords with others.
   - Choose strong and unique passwords when signing up.
   - Ensure that the SQLite database file (`recipe_organizer.db`) is stored securely on your system.

5. **Usage Tips:**
   - Use the `signup` command to create a new user account before accessing other functionalities.
   - Remember your username and password to log in and perform actions within the recipe organizer.
   - Utilize the `forgot_password` command if you forget your password to reset it.
   - Take advantage of the `search` command to quickly find recipes based on keywords.
   - Regularly back up the SQLite database file (`recipe_organizer.db`) to prevent data loss.

Certainly! Here are some sample interactions with the system for Project, along with the expected outputs:
